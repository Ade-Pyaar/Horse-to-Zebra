# Horse-to-Zebra
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/ade-pyaar/horse-to-zebra/app.py)

This is an app that transforms a horse to a zebra.

The app is a GAN model that converts picture of a horse to that of a zebra.

Creepy, right...?

The model is not perfect so there may be some mistakes.

And don't upload a picture that is not a horse, unless you want to see some weird stuff...
