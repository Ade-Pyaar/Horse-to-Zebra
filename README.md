# Horse-to-Zebra
[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/ade-pyaar/horse-to-zebra/app.py)

This is an app that transforms a horse to a zebra, or a zebra to a horse.

The app consists of two GAN models, one converts picture of a horse to that of a zebra and the other converts picture of a zebra to that of a horse.

Creepy, right...?

The model is not perfect so there may be some mistakes (The model converting horse to zebra is better than the one converting zebra to horse).

And don't upload a picture that is not a horse or that is not a zebra, unless you want to see some weird stuff...
